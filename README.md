# stock-portfolio-optimizer
This project aims to apply advanced optimization algorithms to stock portfolio management to maximize expected returns, reduce investment risks, and achieve diversification. Utilizing historical stock data sourced from platforms like Yahoo Finance and the NASDAQ website, we will implement and compare the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and gradient descent methods in portfolio optimization.

In our approach, individual stocks will be represented as chromosomes within a genetic algorithm framework. We will experiment with various mutation, crossover, and selection techniques to evolve portfolios toward optimal performance. Gradient descent algorithms will be employed to find the minimum of a function, such as risk, to balance the portfolio effectively.

To evaluate the performance of the optimized portfolios, we will use key financial metrics including total return, volatility, and the Sharpe ratio. These metrics will help us determine the trade-offs between risk and return in the portfolios generated by different optimization techniques. If time permits, additional factors and metrics will be incorporated to enrich the analysis.

Objectives:

Implement genetic algorithms and gradient descent for portfolio optimization.
Maximize expected returns while minimizing risks.
Achieve portfolio diversification through algorithmic strategies.
Evaluate performance using metrics like total return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio.
Compare different mutation, crossover, and selection methods within the genetic algorithm.
Data Sources:

Historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
Historical stock data from the NASDAQ website.
Note: We are open to questions and feedback to improve our project's scope and methodology.
